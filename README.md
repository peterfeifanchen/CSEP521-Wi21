# CSEP521-Wi21

Demo files for CSEP521

Lots of disclaimers apply.

Of most interest in the stable matching code.  Set N for the number of vertices, and Reps for number of runs to average over.

Under the Stable Matching menu
Permute - create a random permutation (test program)
Init matching - generate a random permutation for the Gale-Shapely algorithm
Proposal - run the G-S algorithm (Requires InitMatching first)
BigProposal - run the G-S algorithm generating permutation on the fly.  
Iterate - run the G-S algorithm Reps times
BigIterate - run the incremental algorithm Reps times
